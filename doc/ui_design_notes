UIs -- what does a minimal command line UI need to do?

List of conversations
-- display a table with columns: sender/alias, date, subject; indicator for read/unread, number unread
-- fill extra space on line with a snippet of the conversation
-- delete
-- inotify --> autorefresh

Messages in a conversation
-- messages in order; render what it can (conservatively)
-- possibly: method of selecting messages; allow user to run commands on messages or use a default command. Alternatively just make it easy to copy the path
-- reply
-- delete
-- inotify --> autorefresh


Possible features later:
-- folders/labels: mostly useful if you actually try to save messages
-- some mechanism for saving messages longer term (set a field in the metadata for how long to keep the message)
-- some mechanism for warning the user before conversations get deleted (enable per conversation? default enable for conversations you've sent mail in?)
-- shortcut on conversation for sending an ACK message
-- something about consistent ordering of messages in a conversation between sender/receiver, or at least alerts of when messages are likely out of order
-- detect if daemon is alive/connectivity state

-- notifications of new messages: separate process (i.e. might want them to be graphical even if you're using a command line client)

TODO: pretend to use the UI. i.e. one person uses it to browse email, another person manually operates the UI. Figure out what features are mising
